## Project Description
we created a clone of AirBnB where we worked on the backend of the project and integrated it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.
This project is the foundation of subsequent projects to be built. Projects like HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration will be interagted into this foundation project.

## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  nothing  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
(hbnb) 
(hbnb)quit
$ 
```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
